# `phi`: my last programming language
phi is a modular and very extensible language based on FORTH, Smalltalk, and
Lisp. It's [bootstrapped from machine code](phi0/theworks.pm) and implements a
[small concatenative bytecode](phi0/interpreter.pm) that is used as an
intermediate representation.

**Work in progress:** I expect to ship this by end of year 2018.
