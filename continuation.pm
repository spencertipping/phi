=head1 Continuation
1. [done] Think about parser representation, but don't worry about it too much.

2. Refactor parsers to not store start locations, and to support insert/delete
deltas.
3. Get a trivial test case for flatmapping parsers.
4. Start writing some DSLs for common things like data processing or CAD.
5. Write a very simple shell.
6. Prototype Perl JIT.
7. Prototype C JIT.

=head1 Flatmapping parsers
1. Simple expression references
2. Lambda syntax (one arg is fine, derefs + methods + maybe operators)
3. Eval methods
