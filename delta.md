## Next steps
1. **Fix infix/concatenative arity problem**
2. Save the infix language as such by writing a simple concatenative compiler
   for optrees (if it's straightforward)
3. Save everything by finishing out the abstract interpreter and figuring out
   where the JIT boundary is
4. Implement LHS destructuring parsers+syntax for infix
