=head1 Frontiers (a stream of consciousness firehose)
Let's abandon all pretense of normal language function for a second.

What I care about is precisely defining the division between dialects and
abstracts. Dialects are more significant than just flavors-of-language; they're
also flavors-of-interconnections -- really, they pick up the residual semantics
from abstracts. Abstracts are the values being driven by dialects.

We can look at dialects in a few ways:

1. Dialects are abstract fabric
2. Dialects are search space fabric
3. Dialects are a network for abstracts

I mean, these are all basically the same thing -- but none imply the usual
linkages that frame-oriented languages tend to have. And that's what interests
me: we have stuff like search spaces. If a dialect drives a solution search,
then the active frame is the frontier.


=head2 Parse time vs runtime
This is a metaclass-vs-class distinction. Metaclasses share an inheritance
relationship with classes.

Frontier metaclasses are a dialect's interface with the rest of the world and
with each other. I think it's that simple. I think we can also use these
metaclasses as possibly-mutable parse states.
