## Static friction force
If I write something like `myfn = fn`, aliasing `fn` for some reason, then the
static friction on `myfn` should be proportional to the number of uses of that
word elsewhere in my code. In other words, I should be able to understand ahead
of time what depends on my definition when I hover over it. (And possibly have a
view where defined words are colored by friction.)
