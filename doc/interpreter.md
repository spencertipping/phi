# Interpreter design
Despite my other docs, phi is a simple data language with just a little bit of
programmability to it. Transformations are driven by the _scope_, which is a
list of rewrite rules. Each rewrite rule is a pair of (parser, template), where
the template is rewritten with the binding list generated by the parser.

The only data structure is the cons cell. Everything else is implemented as a
primitive, of which there are three types:

1. int
2. string
3. object: a unique value you can (request that the interpreter) generate
