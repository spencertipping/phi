type != constant-ness
leaf nodes are either "abstract" or "constant"
tree nodes are always abstract, but might be collapsed
IO returns abstracts; timelines are managed using control flow
  no value dependencies required to do this

control flow -> sequencing?
  can we use parsers to provide try/catch for errors? (seq/alt)
