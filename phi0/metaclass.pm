=head2 Regular classes
Structurally, classes consist of three things:

1. A struct describing the data layout of each instance
2. A string-map of method definitions
3. A list of protocols implemented by the class

Classes can also generate vtables, but they don't track those vtables; the
linkage goes only the other way (from the vtable to the class).

By themselves, classes don't know about any metaprogramming features like
accessor generation or GC. That stuff is managed by metaclasses, which are
functional transformations you apply to class objects.

Before I get into that in detail, let's talk about a basic aspect of classes,
the negotiation around protocols and vtable indexing.


=head3 Protocols and method allocation
A protocol is a set of methods you can use to address some object. The contract
is that any method within a protocol uses the same vtable index across all
implementing classes; so if we have something like this:

  protocol cons_like
  {
    head();
    tail();
  }

...then any class implementing C<head> will use the same vtable slot. This means
a method call to C<head> can be compiled down to a C<method> instruction with a
constant index. Method polymorphism is implemented by vtable polymorphism.

Our boot image has many protocol objects, but from a method allocation point of
view we're effectively having every object delegate all methods through a single
"possibly any method" protocol; that is, each method in the boot image gets a
separate vtable index. This strategy is simple and detects errors well, but it
doesn't scale well. There are plenty of cases where you'll want to have more
than 65536 total distinct methods, and in all likelihood you don't want the
500KiB vtables you'd get when you got close to that limit. Classes and protocols
need to minimize the overall vtable size when allocating vtables.

=head4 Naive allocation strategy: first available slot
We could start by asking the protocol for a vtable slot commitment for a method:

  cons_like.method_index_for("head")

C<cons_like> would then enumerate its implementing classes and offer method
indexes until all of those classes agree to accept some value.

This strategy works but isn't optimal; there's no guarantee that we're
minimizing the overall vtable size because the method allocation ordering
depends on the order of calls to C<method_index_for>. We can do better.

=head4 Global allocation strategy: allocate common methods first
The overall size of generated vtables looks like this:

  âˆ‘ max(method_indexes(c))
  c
