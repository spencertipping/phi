=head2 Jurisdictions
phi is portable, but not in the imperialistic way that Java is. Rather than
building up a full world of uniformity, phi uses domains where certain stated
assumptions hold and compiles code accordingly. These domains are called
jurisdictions.

Code in the same jurisdiction can interoperate efficiently. Anything going on
outside a jurisdiction requires a mediating object to translate between calling
and value storage conventions.

Structurally, a jurisdiction governs the following behaviors:

1. Size and endianness of integers
2. Backend memory model: managed vs flat
3. Backend native compilation characteristics
4. Backend language
5. Object method addressing protocol

Jurisdictions and runtimes aren't the same thing: a runtime can have multiple
jurisdictions for various reasons. You'd likely do this in Javascript if you
were targeting ASM.js or WebAssembly, for example.
