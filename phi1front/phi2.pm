=head2 phi2 language frontend
Here's where things start to get real. We use the machinery defined in phi1 to
parse phi2, which provides a proper infix language with parse-time CTTI
propagation, expression type inference, lexical closure, etc. phi2 is a simple
language that provides enough grammar extensibility to host anything else.

Let's talk a little about how the parsers work internally.


=head3 CTTI interop and parsing
CTTIs themselves don't need to provide parsers in order to participate in a
grammar. Most languages don't have computed grammars in the first place, so
there isn't really a precedent for classes to be syntax-aware; but beyond that,
we can get a lot of mileage from a CTTI's set of offered methods. If some of
those methods look like operators, then those can be integrated into the syntax
as such (and at the appropriate precedence for the dialect in question).

Put differently, CTTIs are at liberty to rely solely on the method/virtual
tables to convey functionality and they can be confident that any frontend will
present those in a sane way.


=head3 ...therefore, a frontend is a single parser
Now we can define a frontend with minimal machinery. The frontend parser can ask
the parse state for the CTTI for a given binding, and use that to parse
identifiers. Once it has such a CTTI, it can parse method/operator invocations
against a given value, compiling/linking those at parse-time. It can also
delegate the parse to any custom continuation for that CTTI (and should, unless
the language just can't accommodate custom extensions).

"Primitive" operations like C's C<+> and pointer-dereference and such are all
specified by one of the CTTIs. We don't need a base case if we have a CTTI that
defines non-virtual methods that bottom out into assembler instructions we can
link using C<symbolic_method>. (C<phi1::class.symbolic_method> takes care of
this for us.)


=head3 Assembling expressions
Most frontends (including phi2) convert expressions to something close to ANF to
flow-assemble them. So we'd have something like this:

  # if we compile this:
  x + y.bar(bif + baz, bok.bork())

  # ...we'd compile it like this:
  let tmp1 = bif + baz in
  let tmp2 = bok.bork() in
  let tmp3 = y.bar(tmp1, tmp2) in
  let tmp4 = x + tmp3 in
  tmp4

C<let>-bindings don't dynamically extend the scope; rather, phi2 finds them up
front and builds a frame class for the full set of referenced variables. That
makes it important for C<tmpN> variables to be unique gensyms in their own
namespace.

Because scopes aren't always defined in parse order, we use parsers to stage
flow assembler links. That is, parsers return objects that do two things:

1. Return a map of C<< name -> CTTI >> entries to describe their definition set
2. Return a set of C<name> entries to describe their reference set
3. Add new links to an existing flow assembler

NB: these links are right-inclusive, just like the tail of a cons cell. There is
no tail-tail or "rest of the list" otherwise.

=head3 Parse state
Frontend parse states are slightly nontrivial because they have a bit of
negotiation to do. In particular, not all frontends support:

1. Lexical scoping and lambda-capture
2. Dynamic scoping
3. Prefix-free variable addressing
4. Variable addressing at all

We need to generalize across these differences so CTTIs that offer custom parse
continuations can refer to defined quantities by name. That makes it possible to
write things like this:

  char const *str = "hello";
  html_element *e =
    html <h1>                           // at this point html owns the parse
           <div>$str</div>              // <- reference to defined variable
         </h1>;

Another way to look at it is that CTTI and scopes are the two sides of the
semantic catalog phi offers to frontends -- just like the file tree and inode
semantics are the two sides of the catalog offered by filesystems.


=head3 Scopes and capture
Parsers store the compile-time scope in the parse state, so we have more or less
a C<< map<string*, ctti*> >> we can consult as a directory. So far so good, but
there are cases where we'll need a bit more firepower than that. For example,
how do we write a frontend that supports lexical capture? Even more confusingly,
how do we differentiate between that and dynamic scoping?

  (lambda (x)
    (lambda (y)
      (+ x y)))                 ; if scheme, x is lexical
                                ; if emacs lisp, x is dynamic

It gets worse. If we count the above ambiguity, we have a few different cases to
think about:

1. Lexical scope + "normal" capture: OCaml, Scheme, JS, Python, Perl, etc
2. Lexical scope + restricted capture: C++
3. Dynamic scope: Emacs Lisp
4. Lexical+dynamic scope: gcc-flavored C
5. No scope connection: standard C

(4) is the intersection of the two scoping models: you get lexical scoping only
for values also within the dynamic scope
(L<https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Nested-Functions.html>).

...again, all of this is less a commentary about how these things would be
implemented than it is a question of how frontends should encode the
compile-time information into the parse state's scope objects.
