=head1 phi boot image generator
This script emits a Linux/AMD64 machine code image. We aren't linked to any
libraries (including libc), so everything bottoms out in terms of system calls
and we aren't at all portable to other POSIX systems. This is an OK place to
start the world; later on we can specify how to build a C+JIT system that
interfaces to system functions using the standard C calling convention. The
image can then port itself to this backend.

Not all backends are low-level; we just start there because it's conveniently
minimalistic. phi can also recompile itself to languages like Javascript,
Python, Ruby, Perl, OCaml, Java, etc, each of which provides some form of GC
and/or OOP. phi is set up to delegate to hosting facilities when they're
available. (Optimizing effectively for each backend is another story that I'll
address within the phi codegen libraries.)

=head2 Object assembler
We could write the phi boot image in assembly language. The big advantage to
doing it in Perl is that we get better automation and finer control over the
exact machine instructions that get emitted. Both of these things matter a lot.

At a high level, here's what we need from an assembler interface:

1. Hex literal bytes
2. Octal literal bytes (mostly for ModR/M encoding)
3. Namespaced labels
4. Absolute positioning/addressing
5. C<pack> references to constants, relative labels, or absolute links

Everything ends up with an absolute address, so the linker can use the standard
two-pass design: allocate space first, then patch in the correct locations. We
don't have any addresses that change size, e.g. C<jmp label> in assembly; all of
the sizes are hard-coded up front and we do a quick overflow check to make sure
C<jmp short> (and other small-value) instructions are within range.


=head3 Authoring things
What we really need is something that behaves like a string but remains valid
(in the binary-linkage sense) even if we don't know the heap location of
everything up front. We should be able to insert C<pack> placeholders whose
values will later be computed, and we should also be able to easily grab a
pointer to any location within a string.

I think we want something like this:

  my $fn   = asm->c3;
  my $code = asm->e8pl($fn - right)->c3;

We first add everything to the heap; then once the addresses are set, the
objects can go back and patch themselves.

=head2 Value types, pointers, and stacks
Let's talk about C for a second.

Idiomatic C can't be garbage collected accurately because we can't look at the
heap and know where the pointers are -- nor is there any guarantee that pointers
are even stored in any sane format. (XOR-linked lists, for example.) On the
bright side, C does provide some nice things like full-width unboxed integers
and floats.

C does have an understanding of pointer types, though; so if pointer/int casts
(and arbitrary memory access in general) were disallowed then it would be
possible to correctly GC it. C's stack layout is fully managed, so calculating
the root set is trivial.

FORTH is more challenging. The pointer/int casting rule isn't sufficient to add
GC because unlike in C, FORTH's stack types are generally unknown. That is, we
can't look at the data stack at a moment in time and understand which things on
it are pointers. If we wanted to be able to do this, we'd have to keep a bit of
separate information per entry indicating such.

Both languages are untyped in the sense that operators (mostly) reinterpret
their operands, but C is statically untyped while FORTH is dynamically untyped.

Polymorphic OOP, of course, doesn't work in an untyped world. We need some type
of runtime type information to be preserved per value in order to know which
variant of a method to resolve to. So our language becomes dynamically and
(probably) strongly typed. To the extent that coercion happens, it's driven by
the objects themselves -- objects are self-aware and self-managing.

If we take this principle to a logical extreme, there's no reason the garbage
collector needs to know anything about pointers or anything else. In fact,
there's no reason the language even needs a garbage collector. Objects with
direct memory access can be self-allocating, self-tracing, and self-relocating.

So ... how do we get to this wonderful paradise? The simplest strategy is to
kick things off with a concatenative, method-calling base with a few
instructions to rearrange the stack. Stack entries are value types, some of
which are pointers -- but the details of pointer dereferencing are delegated to
classes.


=head3 Base classes
vtables serve a structural role in phi's OOP implementation, but they are
themselves objects. They need to be in order to be garbage-collected (phi has no
permgen; if it did, you'd never be able to reclaim the bootup class/code objects
after replacing them).


=head4 Metaclasses and vtables
Any object-oriented language with reflection faces the bottoming-out problem:
what is C<x.class.class>? phi's model is that C<class> is an instance of itself.

This would normally be a problem because the method-call machinery would be
self-referential, but phi introduces the class->vtable compilation step as a
layer of indirection to fix this. Rather than having the class _perform_ the
method calls, the class _compiles_ method calls (technically, protocols compile
method calls, but the principle is the same). So classes are source objects that
get compiled into vtables, which are the low-level things that implement
polymorphism.
=cut

use constant vtable_vtable => asm;
vtable_vtable->pQ(vtable_vtable);

# TODO: automate vtable construction more than this; we'll want to
# macro-generate the object fields/etc
sub object($) { asm->pQ(shift) }
sub vtable()  { object vtable_vtable }


=head4 Here pointers
There are cases where we'll want to refer to the middle of a structure for
linkage reasons. For example, a lot of references to native code should be
C<jmp>-able, so we want to point to the first byte of executable machine code,
but that machine code is owned and managed by a phi object whose base offset
comes a bit before. These cases are negotiated using C<here> pointers, each of
which is preceded by a two-byte struct offset. It would be like this in C:

  struct x *here = ...;
  struct x *base = (struct x*) ((char*) here - ((unsigned short*) here)[-1]);

In memory terms we have this:

                 here-pointer - heremarker = object root
                 |
  object root    |        here-pointer points here
  |              |        |
  V              V        V
  vtable ... heremarker | native code/whatever

All we need to do is keep track of whether we have a here-pointer, a regular
pointer, or something else.
=cut

sub phi::asm::here_marker
{
  my $asm = shift;
  $asm->pS(phi::right - $asm);
}


=head3 Value classes
Every stack entry will end up being prefixed with a vtable pointer that
specifies how we should interpret that entry. This means our primitive
instructions are actually not how we will manipulate the stack at all; we'll end
up making method calls against stack things, which will push, pop, and rearrange
themselves for us.
=cut

use constant pointer_vtable     => vtable;
use constant herepointer_vtable => vtable;
use constant int_vtable         => vtable;
use constant float_vtable       => vtable;


=head3 Instruction set
The simplest way to get this thing off the ground is to have a very small
handful of machine-code primitives that we then string together into functions.
These primitives don't need to be aware of OOP/memory management at all; they're
basically C-style int/pointer operations that operate in a concatenative way.

Why bother defining instructions above machine code? Because they're portable:
we want to minimize the processor-specific dependencies as much as we can. (None
of which precludes us from writing an optimizing compiler for any given backend
down the line.)

These instructions look almost exactly like FORTH primitives, and in fact I'm
going to use exactly the same register allocations that Jonesforth does:

  %rbp = return stack pointer
  %rsp = data stack pointer
  %rsi = instruction pointer
  %rdi = the interpreter object (not in Jonesforth; more below)

Our threading model is pretty different from Jonesforth. We don't execute
machine code directly; instead, we have a little bytecode interpreter that
includes some escapes for custom machine code sections. Specifically, here's our
instruction set (each is one byte):

  0x00 - 0x0f: invalid instructions (makes debugging easier)

  0x10 = lit8 (two-byte instruction)
  0x11 = lit16 (three-byte instruction)
  0x12 = lit32 (five-byte instruction)
  0x13 = lit64 (nine-byte instruction)

  0x18 - 0x1f: integer constants 0-7

  0x20 = call-native
  0x21 = call-interpreted
  0x22 = method-call-nth
  0x23 = if
  0x24 = iget
  0x25 = iset
  0x26 = dstack-get
  0x27 = dstack-set
  0x28 = rstack-get
  0x29 = rstack-set
  0x2a = rpush
  0x2b = rpop
  0x2c = ret

  0x30 = swap
  0x31 = dup
  0x32 = drop
  0x33 = over
  0x34 = rot3<
  0x35 = nth (two-byte instruction)

  0x40 = <mem8
  0x41 = >mem8
  0x42 = <mem64
  0x43 = >mem64
  0x44 = memcpy

  0x50 = int+
  0x51 = int*
  0x52 = int<<
  0x53 = int>>
  0x54 = int>>>
  0x55 = int&
  0x56 = int|
  0x57 = int^
  0x58 = int<
  0x59 = int==
  0x5a = intunary~
  0x5b = intunary-

  0x80 - 0xbf: one-byte method call (0 - 31)
  0xc0 - 0xef: two-byte method call (32 - 12063)
  0xf0 - 0xff: three-byte method call (12064 - 524287)

TODO: instructions for managed languages? These all assume a flat memory model
with some amount of JIT capability. So we can target machine code, ASM.js, and
low-level bytecodes.

Using one byte per instruction means that our advancement primitive (NEXT in
Jonesforth) requires an additional instruction:

  # phi                                 # jonesforth
  xorq %rax, %rax                       lodsd
  lodsb                                 jmp *%eax
  jmp *(%rdi + 8*%rax)

C<%rdi> stores a here-pointer to the interpreter's bytecode dispatch table, so
there's no displacement. This reduces our overall code size.


=head4 Threading macros
These maintain registers and manage control flow. Every builtin instruction must
end with C<next> to advance the interpreter forwards.
=cut

sub phi::asm::next                      # 7 bytes

       ->_488bo064o310;                 # movq *(%rax + 8*%rcx), %rsi
}


=head4 Code objects
The interpreter contains a dispatch table with 256 entries, one per bytecode
instruction. Each entry is an absolute pointer to the linkable address of a
machine code object, which is itself independently GC-able and contains some
metadata about the operation it represents.

=head4 Primitive method calls
The "method call" instructions always address the object pointed to by C<%rsp>,
which, in stack terms, is a value rather than a reference. Calling the nth
method involves using its vtable to fetch a pointer to a phi bytecode list, then
calling into that list. In other words, C<mcall(n)> is a much faster version of
this:

  dup <mem64                            # get vtable pointer
  lit(n) lit(8) int* int+               # get code pointer
  call-interpreted                      # invoke the method

NB: the method call instruction internals require their own instruction byte to
be present in C<%al>. This is a natural consequence of C<next>, which uses
C<lodsb>, but it's worth pointing out that this is a formal requirement.

=head3 Interpreter object
The instruction set isn't OOP-aware, but the interpreter is an object. This is
important for a couple of reasons. First, the fact that the interpreter is just
a regular object means that it can be replaced; and second, as an object, it
ends up following the normal GC protocol so this replacement can happen
automatically when you stop referring to it.

=head3 Backend variants
We want to be able to run within different languages, the set of which spans
things like memory models, OOP/functional, and other paradigm differences. Some
cases like ASM.js involve bridging that gap within the same runtime. Because all
of this involves hard limits (we don't want to emulate a flat memory model if
the runtime provides GC for us), phi provides an operation that tells you about
the features available on the current runtime. Then you'll know which
instructions are enabled.

=head4 C<gc>
This is the biggest question mark for a runtime: how is memory managed? There
are a few options:

1. C<flat>: no GC; you have direct memory access (e.g. C, C++, machine code)
2. C<named>: no references/pointers (e.g. Perl4, POSIX sh, sed)
3. C<refcount>: cycles need to be broken, finalizers happen instantly (Perl5)
4. C<sync_tracing>: synchronous (pausing) mark/sweep (OCaml, Ruby?)
5. C<async_tracing>: concurrent mark/sweep (Java)

TODO: finalizer support?

=head4 C<int_size>
Basically, how big an int can we work with before overflowing a register? Sadly,
the number of bits is not always an even power of two; V8, OCaml, and Lisp each
use some form of bit tagging, reducing the effective integer precision to
slightly fewer than the native number of bits. On a 64-bit machine, this usually
means we get anywhere from 52 to 63 bits to work with (52 comes up if the
runtime pushes ints into NaN float values).

C<int_size> uses eight bits to encode the number of bits available in integers.

=head4 C<jit>
This setting can take on a few different values:

1. C<free>: there is no JIT overhead at all, e.g. machine code
2. C<fast>: you can quickly compile code at runtime, e.g. C<eval>
3. C<slow>: you can compile code via linkage, e.g. with the JVM; expect permgen
4. C<none>: you can't JIT anything; you'd have to restart the process


=head2 Classes and protocols
In a world with only classes, we'd need to allocate a separate vtable index for
every single method, which would take up a lot of space:

  # the world without protocols: every class contains four vtable entries
  class A {
    method foo;     # vtable index 0
    method bar;     # vtable index 1
  }
  class B {
    method foo;     # vtable index 0
    _               # vtable index 1 is blank to avoid A::bar conflict
    method bif;     # vtable index 2
    method baz;     # vtable index 3
  }

This is equivalent to every class belonging to a single protocol that contains
the union of everyone's methods.

We can fix this by specifying which classes are eligible for which virtual
method calls, in this case by adding them to a protocol object:

  protocol has_foo {
    method foo;     # same vtable index within all member classes
  }
  class A : has_foo {
    method foo;     # vtable index 0
    method bar;     # vtable index 1
  }
  class B : has_foo {
    method foo;     # vtable index 0
    method bif;     # vtable index 1 (no collision with A::bar)
    method baz;     # vtable index 2
  }

This is basically how method resolution works in statically-typed languages like
Java or C++; phi also uses static typing when it comes to classes/methods, it
just has more support for runtime code generation.

Every virtual method invocation, then, addresses a protocol rather than a class.
Any class-focused method invocations are static function calls and are likely to
be inlined during compilation.

NB: we can't modify vtables once they're allocated, so compiled classes,
vtables, and dynamic method calls are all immutable once you start using them.
It's theoretically possible to enumerate heap objects and rewrite their vtables
if all you're doing is adding new methods to things, but that's a library thing
instead of something built into the object system.

=head2 Build the image
This is pretty simple: we just write the entire heap contents into a file and
call it a day. This works because the heap begins with ELF header allocations
that locate it properly in memory.


=head3 Debugging code
Let's write some macros to make life much much easier. Basically, we want to
have some things we can drop into machine code to tell us what's going on inside
the image. We don't have libc, so int->string and such are functions we'll have
to write for ourselves if we want them.

=head3 ELF header
These behave like heap allocations because of page alignment. Basically, let's
say our virtual address space starts at 0x400000; because the ELF file is
memory-mapped rather than copied, we have the constraint that we can "move" the
file's contents only by increments of 4096 bytes -- whole pages. We can't assign
an arbitrary offset, e.g. to skip the ELF header.

This isn't much of a problem really. As far as phi is concerned, our initial
heap is maybe 120 bytes smaller than it would normally be because it's got some
mystery data (the ELF headers) prepended; then that will get garbage collected
because nothing refers into it. So the net impact of our ELF headers ends up
being zero, exactly what we want.
