=head2 Bootup strategy
How we get to the endpoint isn't the same as which endpoint we're going for; as
a result, the objects we use to boot phi aren't directly related to the set of
objects we ultimately want.

More specifically, phi ends up being a series of class and bytecode objects that
are here-linked to each other. We have three ways to get the bytecode:

1. Hand-write using C<bin>
2. Use Perl abstraction to compile it
3. Generate method calls to phi objects to ask them to generate it

Of those options, the latter gives us the most reusable leverage. So we need to
hand-write enough stuff to get phi objects that can compile other phi objects.
...and that, of course, means that we need to specify what phi is compiling.
