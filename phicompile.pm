=head1 phi optree compiler
A compiler for optrees. This translates an optree graph into concatenative code
using a series of node parsers. We could use a literal translation, but it
wouldn't be optimal; instead, this compiler optimizes a few low-level details to
produce faster code.

phi is a pretty easy backend to target. Let's talk about what it looks like to
translate different elements into concatenative code.

First, binary expressions like C<(+ x y)> just become C<x y +>, with an inline
operator invocation and inlined operands. There's a bit more to it than is
obvious here: what happens if C<x> and C<y> refer to C<arg> or C<capture>? We
need to track the stack offsets of those values.

...that brings us to the next point: what does our calling convention look like?
I think it's pretty simple; let's go through a function with some captured
state.


=head2 Compiling functions and closure state
The interpreter stores C<arg> and C<capture> on the hosted data stack, which
means those values are addressible. The compiler needs to drop those values into
the target data stack, which means we need to replace the values themselves with
stack indexes.

Functions need to be proper closures in order to interoperate with concatenative
code. For example, we might use C<philist::list_map> from infix; the lambda will
need to be self-sufficient in order to follow the calling convention C<list_map>
expects.

In practice this is straightforward. We can compile the body of the function
with the expectation that its arguments are positioned like this on the stack:

  argN argN-1 ... arg2 arg1 [capturelist]

A function then compiles into code which conses the capture list onto the quoted
body. For example, for C<< \x -> x + 5 >>, where C<5> is captured (NB: we're
referring to a single argument here; no stack conversion is happening):

  # we ultimately want this (NB: this is a lie; see "Function calls" below)
  [[5] head +]

  # here's the code to generate this function:
  [head +]                              # [f...]
  [] [5] head ::                        # [f...] [capture-list]
  ::                                    # [[capture-list] f...]


=head2 C<arg> and C<capture> references
Technically, C<arg> and C<capture> refer to things that don't move. The only
variable is the number of things we've pushed onto the stack as working values,
and that's what we track.


=head2 Function calls
Functions map stacks to stacks via C<arg> -- but C<arg> is addressed as a single
list value. This means that if we want to provide a literal translation, we need
to quote the incoming data stack into a list value. So our function body would
look something like this:

  [ i> head tail‚Åø [capture-list] body... d< ]

This, of course, is inefficient: if we can modify the optree stuff to refer to
numbered arguments we'll be in a better place.

TODO: get this right; at the moment the mismatch between concatenative and
applicative calling conventions is pretty bogus.

=head2 Compilation strategy
The goal here is to make infix code performance-competitive with concatenative.
L<phiinterp> adds a bunch of overhead to relatively simple expressions, e.g.
C<binop(+, const(3), const(4))> -- which would be much more efficiently written
in concatenative as:

  3 4 +

That's a fairly literal transcription of the optree, but not all expressions
should be compiled literally. The infix syntax introduces a lot of inline
lambdas that create a nontrivial amount of overhead of their own; let's talk
about that for a moment.

=head3 Condensing inline lambdas
C<let x = y in z> gets compiled into C<call(fn([arg=x] z), y)> -- so we have a
function we immediately invoke. A literal compilation would be:

  compile(y) [ compile(fn([arg=x] z)) ] .

There are two optimizations we can make:

1. Inline the function list to eliminate C<.>
2. Do clever things to avoid computing intermediate capture lists

Of these, (2) confers far more advantage.
