=head1 phi builtin type/abstract definitions
Alright, let's define some actual types now that C<philang> works. Parse
continuations are technically managed by values rather than types, but in
practice most abstract values will delegate to a type to keep it simple. (Rarely
do specifics of a value impact the set of operations you can perform on it.)

=head2 Operator precedence
Before I get into the details, let's talk about some high-level stuff. First,
most values support operator precedence by looking at the surrounding operator
and removing lower-precedence stuff from the continuation:

  int.parse_continuation("+") = [[* ...], [/ ...], [** ...] ...]

It's worth having some functions to handle this for us so we can specify the
operator lists declaratively.

=head2 Unowned (universal) operators
Second, many languages like Haskell and OCaml support operators-as-constructors,
e.g. C<::> for cons. Given that values-via-types are the sole drivers for parse
continuations, type-independent operators like C<::> appear to be off the table
by design. (And we can't do something independent of the
operator/parse-continuation mechanism simply because then we'll break
precedence.) Fortunately we do have some options:

1. Programmatically add operators to existing types by rewriting the types
2. Use lexical scopes to maintain operator-constructors as metadata
3. Have types talk to some lexically-scoped value to ask about extra ops
4. Implement a type hierarchy

(1) is inconvenient and requires symbolic refs between abstract values and
types. This means we have a nametable somewhere, which we might want for other
reasons but I'm not sure I want to force it for this feature. (For example, how
bad is it really if someone just hard-links the type? It shouldn't break things
like this.)

(2) is just egregious. This involves a whole new metadata channel inside the
scoping object, which is likely to become an open-ended namespace of fail that
you could drive a truck through. Let's make the rule that lexical scopes can't
store arbitrary data just to avoid this outcome.

(3) and (4) differ only in how they're scoped: (3) allows you to add operators
on a lexically-scoped basis, whereas (4) is dynamically scoped. I prefer (3) in
this case simply because it greatly reduces the chances of breaking stuff
through monkey-patching. There's also nothing wrong with having both mechanisms
available.

Getting into the details a bit, (3) requires some kind of symbolic linkage, but
it's not terrible simply because operators themselves are symbolic quantities.
So there's nothing wrong with us binding the name C<::> lexically and having
that become an operator. The only question is how a type would understand that
C<::> is an operator, vs something like C<x> which is a value (and the intended
precedence of C<::>, although maybe it's up to the type to slot it in wherever
it stacks up). We also need to prevent C<::> from parsing as a name.

I think we have enough machinery to do all of this. First, if we want something
not to parse as a value, all we have to do is specify C<fail> as its parse
continuation; then it will parse only as an atom, never as an expression. It's
fine to have parse continuations be forcing elements this way.

Next we need to have C<::> indicate that it can be parsed as an operator. This
is a great opportunity for abstraction: perhaps we want regular values to be
able to behave as operators in some cases, for instance deltas, units,
encodings, or timezones: C<30cm> has C<cm>, a value, behaving as a postfix
operator and modifying another value. Any value could potentially take this
role.

Let's look at C<30cm> from C<30>'s point of view. Its parse continuation
contains an alternation of type-specific operators and atoms, where the atoms
are modified by asking whether they want to postfix-modify C<30>. We have
something like this:

  30.parse_continuation = alt("+" expr,
                              "-" expr,
                              ...,
                              atom >>= postfix_modify)

If an atom doesn't intend to function as an operator then its C<postfix_modify>
can accept a value and then return C<fail> as its parse continuation,
effectively rejecting the parse. This will cause the whole value to be reparsed
and other alternatives to be considered, which I think is correct.

If the atom does intend to modify a value, then C<postfix_modify> will return a
modified abstract that can dictate its parse continuation normally.
