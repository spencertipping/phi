# 2018-06-23 sprint planning
## Early morning
- **WIP:** Spec out a POC bootup process for inlined value structs
- **WIP:** Object-generating objects (constructors)
- **Done:** Branching within `bin` snippets

## Late morning
- **Mostly done:** Figure out non-GC boot env logistics
- **WIP:** Sketch out compiler interface ideas

1. Objects to mirror bytecodes; then `[...] [...] compiler .if` for example
2. Macro bytecode assembler to handle frames
3. Classes as compilers
4. Local vars as computed frame scopes
5. Captured values as in `philang`
6. Might as well jump straight into parsing once we have that
