# 2018-06-23 sprint planning
## Early morning
- Spec out a POC bootup process for inlined value structs
  - I think we want a separate boot context where GC atomicity doesn't matter...?
  - Bytecode buffer objects that can be concatenated
  - Function objects (possibly same as above)
  - Use structs to generate bytecode
- Object-generating objects (constructors)
- Spec out the philang port from the first iteration
  - Autogenerate frames for local scope?
  - Figure out how frame allocation should work?
