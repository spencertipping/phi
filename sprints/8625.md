# 2018.0625 sprint planning
## Early morning
A few things that can be worked on:

1. Class-aware bytecode compiler in phi
2. Parsers
3. General data structures

We need GC atomicity to work before we get any real code reuse, so arguably (1)
is the highest priority -- but all of these are fairly important and to some
extent interdependent.
