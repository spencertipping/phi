# 2018.0630 sprint planning
- API refinements for consed structs (no getter/setter required)
- Document the API in more detail: who owns memory content translation/etc
  - NB: not entirely straightforward because we have packed counts
- Unit tests for consed structs
- Start metaclass/metaprotocol
- Pack existing classes/protocols into phi1?
